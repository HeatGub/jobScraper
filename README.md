## requirements
- **browser:** I used chrome, currently version 132.0 (check in chrome://settings/help)
- **matching browser driver:** https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ (same version as browser needed)
- **packages:** *pip install -r requirements.txt* (executed in the folder where requirements.txt file is). I suggest installing in a virtual environment as there are quite a lot of them
